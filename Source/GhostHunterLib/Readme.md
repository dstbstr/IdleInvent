# Ghost Hunter
A game about being a scientist, charlatan, or spirtualist

Perhaps you take a selection of tools, rent a location, and produce media.
So take a level 1 camera and a level 1 EMF detector,
 rent a "haunted" shed, and take pictures and EMF recordings
 after a run, you produce pictures from the camera, and an article from the recording.
 These media are sold for money, and the cycle repeats
